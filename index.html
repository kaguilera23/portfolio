                <p>I used to be an ophthalmic technician for 2.5 years. I received a B.S. in Neuroscience from Mercer University. Although I love neuroscience, I don't like reasearch and should have realized sooner that's what I'd be doing if I pursued such a degree. I've been coding for two weeks now. I haven't cried yet, but I do think my hair is falling out. I wanted to learn to code because I would like to be a QA Engineer. Debugging seems very fun. I have two dogs, Sugar and Titus, who are 60 and 150 pounds, respectively. When I'm not coding (which won't be much between now and March 2023), I like to hike and camp.</p>
