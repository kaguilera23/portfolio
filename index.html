                    <p>This will be the first paragraph that I write about myself. If I write a lot of content then the hope is that it will wrap itself. I feel like I have something in this code that will wrap it for me, but you never know because I have no idea what I'm doing. I have two brothers. I'm not really sure what I'm doing. I have a very cute boyfriend named Kyle.</p>
                    <p>So they wrapped themselves! That was kind of exciting because if it didn't wrap then I might've cried. I think it's fairly normal to cry when you're taking this coding class because it's like learning a new language, but no one ever wants to be bad at anything! We just went to Hawaii for two weeks and hiked in a cloud, it was like a dream come true</p>
